// First-class functions:
// JavaScript has first-class functions. This enables us to write higher-order functions
// JavaScript is a language that has first-class functions, which in technical terms means that functions are so called 'first-citizens'
// This means that functions are treated as values
// Functions are just another type of objects and since objects are values, functions are values too and since functions are values,
// we can store them in variables or object properties

// Higher-order functions:
// Because JavaScript has first-class functions makes it possible for us to use and write higher-order functions
// Higher-order function is either a function that receives another function as an argument or a function that returns another function

// First-class vs higher-order function
// First-class function is just a feature that a programming language has or doesn't have, all it means is that all functions are values. It's just a concept
// There are higher-order functions in practice which are possible because the language supports first-class functions
