/* 
We can use constructor functions to build an object using a function. Constructor function is a completely normal function
The only difference between a regular function and a function that we call constructior function, is that we call
a constructor function with the NEW operator
*/

/*
In OOP there is a convention that constructor function always start with a capital letter
Both function expression and function declaration will work, but arrow function will not as a function constructor
It's because it doesn't have its own .this keyword
